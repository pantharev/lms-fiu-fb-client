# Introduction

In todayâ€™s age of technology, getting an education online via online courses has never been easier. However, people from underdeveloped countries are often cut off from accessing these courses due to limitations on their internet data. Facebook allows underdeveloped regions to access their application for free with no data charges. The purpose of the application we have developed is to provide a **Learning Management System** that is accessible entirely through Facebook, allowing students from anywhere in the world to come and take online courses with no data charges.

# Current System

A 3rd version Single Page Application Web-App that is integrated into Facebook. To further elaborate, previous developers have created systems in a similar matter. Each time being iterated upon by new developers (us included).


# Purpose of New System

Create a manageable system using the MEAN (MySQL, Express, Angular, NodeJS) full-stack which can run on Facebook. The system is a Learning Management System which was created for underdeveloped regions to access through Facebook with no data charges. This system will be the 4th version of the platform.


# User Interface

### Course Library

### Admin Dashboard

Here, admins can create and manage courses, and manage user roles. In this system, there are three roles: Admin, Instructor, and Student. Furthermore, the pending enrollments notification signifies that students have applied for enrollment and are awaiting for approval to enter the course. The admin is the one who decides the approval of entry.
